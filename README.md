Skills used: JS

-   Factory functions
-   IIFE/module pattern
-   closures
-   DOM manipulation
-   Retrieving form information

HTML/CSS

-   Grid
-   Flexbox
-   variables
-   Transform/stranslate
-   Created module pop-up
-   Gradients
-   Font
-   Form styling

Challenges:

-   Deciding which variables had to be global vs just local
-   Most challenges were related to design. Which method should go in which of the main functions (gameController vs displayController)
-   The assignment suggested using one factory and two modules (playerFactory, gameController, displayController, and an additional gameBoard function). However, I didn't find it necessary to use playerFactory as the only player information I took in was the player's names, and I just needed a function to send the names to gameController (function name is formRetrieve).

Ways to improve:

-   Being more organized in the future. I created the UI first and then tackled logic, which slowed me down as I was troubleshooting UI as well as logic. In the future I will separate those.
-   Better separation of concerns.
-   I would like to add an impossible AI difficulty in the future.
